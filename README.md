# PRODIGY_ML_02
Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history

Project Overview
This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchasing behavior. By analyzing annual income and spending score, the model groups customers into distinct clusters. 

Dataset:
The dataset contains customer demographic and behavioral information, including:
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1–100)
Source:Kaggle – Customer Segmentation Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

Technologies & Libraries
Python – Core programming language used
pandas – Data loading and preprocessing
NumPy – Numerical operations
Matplotlib – Data visualization
scikit-learn – Implementation of K-Means and model evaluation

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: Selected relevant features (Annual Income, Spending Score).

Optimal Cluster Selection: Utilized the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Clustering: Applied the K-Means algorithm to group customers into segments.

Visualization: Plotted the resulting clusters.

Key Results
Optimal Number of Clusters: 5

Insights:
Identified clearly separable customer segments.
Helps in easy enablement of tailored marketing and engagement strategies based on cluster characteristics.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation. The visual outputs and cluster analysis provide actionable insights that can drive business strategy and customer engagement.
